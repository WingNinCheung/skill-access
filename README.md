# Skill Access

Skill Access is a dynamic web application that empowers users to evaluate engineers' coding and communication skills using a preloaded dataset.

Users can enter a candidate ID within the range of 889-947 and gain insights into the candidate's performance. Skill Access calculates percentiles for their coding and communication scores, showcasing how the candidate compares to others with the same job title and within similar companies.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises two Excel spreadsheets: one containing coding and communication scores and titles (e.g., Senior Engineer) of engineers from various real-world companies, and the other listing companies along with their fractal_indexâ€”a metric that determines company similarity. Companies with a fractal_index of less than 0.15 are considered similar.

- score-records.csv contains the coding and communication scores for all of the users in our sample dataset (https://github.com/WingNinCheung/skill-access/blob/main/backend/data/score-records.csv)
- companies.csv contains the list of firms along with their fractal_index (https://github.com/WingNinCheung/skill-access/blob/main/backend/data/companies.csv)

(A similar company is any company who's absolute difference of fractal_index is less than 0.15. A company is similar to itself)

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React, JavaScript
- Backend: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL
- Testing: Playwright

## Instruction to Run Locally

1. Navigate to a directory and run below on your terminal:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/WingNinCheung/skill-access.git
    ```
2. Create a PostgreSQL user and database (Please install <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> first)
    ```
    psql 
    CREATE USER <YOUR_NAME> WITH CREATEDB PASSWORD '<YOUR_PW>';
    CREATE DATABASE <DATABASE_NAME> WITH OWNER <YOUR_NAME>;
    ```
3. Create .env in the root directory (Based on the info in .env.example)
    ```
    FLASK_APP=__init__
    FLASK_ENV=development
    SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<YOUR_NAME>:<YOUR_PW>@localhost/<DATABASE_NAME>
    ```
4. Install dependencies
    - Frontend
    ```
    cd <your_root_directory>
    npm install
    ```
    - Backend
    ```
    cd /backend
    pip install pipenv
    pipenv install
    pipenv shell
    ```
5. Run it
   - Backend
   ```
   cd /backend
   flask run
   ```
   - Frontend
   ```
   cd <your_root_directory>
   npm start
   ```
   Go to http://localhost:3000/

## Run Automated Tests

  - Navigate to the root directory and run
    ```
    npm run test
    ```
